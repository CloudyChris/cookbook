# A kind of fish borsch (slightly spicy)

## Quantity: about 8 liters of borsch

## Ingredients:
- 1 medium to big beet root
- 3 medium potatos
- 1 above average carrot
- 2 medium-small onions
- about a third of a medium sized cabbage
- 4-5 cloves of garlic
- 3.5 liters of water
- about 400 grams of fish heads and tails for best taste

## Preparation:

### Step 1:
- Start by putting your fish in a pot and covering it with water and put on the lid
- You'll let this bad boy boil for about 2 hours and a half, but after about an hour, take the lid off

### Step 2:
- While your fish is enjoying a nice bath, it's time to peel the potatoes and beet root and dice them into somewhat small cubes (they will boil more thoroughly if small)
- Chop the cabbage into small pieces too, and put them all in another pot, cover with those 3.5 liters of water, and set to boil
- Add 1 teaspoon of hot paptrika
- Add 1 teaspoon of sweet paprika
- Add about 3 tablespoons of salt (after taste)
- Add 1 table spoon of balsamic vinegar (optional)
- Add 2 teaspoons of summer savory
- Add a bit of ground white pepper

### Step 4:
- Take your onions and cut them in half and then into small-ish half rings
- Take the carrot and cut it into small disks
- Dice your garlic
- Add some olive oil or sunflower oil to a pan, and put cook the onion and carrot there (Ideally, cover with a lid and check periodically to not burn it)
- When the onions and carrots are almost done, add the garlic (We put it in late so it doesn't burn)
- When it's all nice and soft, put it in the pot with the beet roots, potatos and cabbage

### Step 5 (optional):
- While you wait for your meat and borsch to boil, might as well enjoy some... potato. In liquid form. We're making a russian-inspired recipe, so it makes sense to engage with the traditional pastime of getting hammered on vodka.

### Step 6:
- When it seems like the fish water level won't go down anymore, or when you're tired of waiting, take a strainer and pour the liquid from the fish pot into the veggie pot, and then lower the strainer with the fish parts into the veggie pot (we're trying to avoid spillage)

### Step 7:
- Check if the beet root and potato are soft enough (note, the beet root might seem a bit hard even when the potato is really soft, but that's normal, we don't have forever, you can blow some more in it and try to bite it yourself. It should be relatively soft)
- When the boiling's done, turn off the fire and add a tablespoon of lovage and a tablespoon of parsley

### Step 8:
- Serve with a bit of sour cream and dill
